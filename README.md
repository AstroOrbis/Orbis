# Orbis
An open-source client to be used on anarchy servers / any server really

# Credits
I used a lot of code from Meteor Client, look them up

# Licence notes

Please make all forks into pull requests.

# Usage
1. Wait until I make the client
2. Drag into .minecraft/mods
3. Load up whatever forge version corresponds to your preferred release version (Currently NONE, 1.12.2 and 1.16.5 planned)
4. Profit (or get instantly banned)

# Author's note
I do not take responsibility for misuse of this code; If you get banned, you get banned. End of story. No complaining "oH bUt AsTrO mAdE tHe ClIeNt So He ShOulD bE pUnIsHEd!11!!". It's your fault you installed it. Now shut up and find another server to hack on, or just play on anarchy.
